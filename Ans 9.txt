9. API documentation should be using swagger.

API Documentation
API documentation is a technical content deliverable, containing instructions about how to effectively use and integrate with an API. 
API Documentation has traditionally been done using regular content creation and maintenance tools and text editors.

Swagger
Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help us to design, build, document and consume REST APIs.
The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all awesomeness in Swagger.

The major Swagger tools include:
Swagger Editor — browser-based editor where one can write OpenAPI specification
Swagger UI — renders OpenAPI specs as interactive API documentation
Swagger Codegen — generates server stubs and client libraries from an OpenAPI specification
