6.)You need to have sorting on the employees list/department list.
 
Collections class has a method sort() which takes List implementation such as ArrayList, LinkedList etc.

Here we will create a list of employees and then sort a list of employees using the OrderBy() method based on salary and then check the department of employees using the Linq Where() method.

Program:-
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Employee
{
    int ID;
    string Name;
    int Salary;
    string Department;

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return ID + " " + Name+" "+Salary + " "+Department;
    }

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<Employee> employees = new List<Employee>()
        {
             new Employee {ID=101,   Name="Amit  "    , Salary=4000,Department="ABC"},
             new Employee {ID=102,   Name="Gautam"    , Salary=6000,Department="XYZ"},
             new Employee {ID=103,   Name="Salman"    , Salary=3000,Department="ABC"},
             new Employee {ID=104,   Name="Ram   "    , Salary=2000,Department="XYZ"},
             new Employee {ID=105,   Name="Shyam "    , Salary=7000,Department="ABC"},
             new Employee {ID=106,   Name="Kishor"    , Salary=5000,Department="XYZ"},
        };


        var result = employees.Where(emp=>emp.Department=="ABC").OrderBy(sal => sal.Salary);


        Console.WriteLine("ID  Name  Salary  Department");
        Console.WriteLine("=========");
        foreach (Employee emp in result)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(emp.ToString());
        }
        Console.WriteLine("=========");
    }
}
