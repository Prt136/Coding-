Q .2)You need to think from OOPS concept and do the coding. Use Classes & Objects for accepting data and data transmission.
   Class=A class is simply a representation of a type of object. It is the blueprint, or plan, or template, that describes the details of an object. 
   Object= object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables.
   Data transmission= refers to the process of transferring data between two or more digital devices.

class student
{
private:
 int roll_num,int age,chr name,char gender;  // data members
public:
  void addStudent(int roll_null,char name,intage);
  void editStudent(int roll_num,char name int age);
};

void main()
{
student stu;
stu.addStudent(101,priya,19);
stu.editStudent(102,riya,19);
}
