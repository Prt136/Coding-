7.) Implement searching of data based on any field search. (for this you can use any algorithm either on API side or on DB side by means of functions)?

Searching of data -
Searching is the process of finding a given value position in a list of values. It decides whether a search key is present in the data or not. It is the algorithmic process of finding a particular item in a collection of items.

Functions-
Functions allow you to define and execute server-side logic for your application. 
A System Function is a function that runs as the system user rather than an application user.

Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.
