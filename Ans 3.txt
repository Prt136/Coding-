 how to setup nodejs project using ts.
--TypeScript--
 1) Open-source programming languages fom Microsoft. 
 2) Typed superset of javaScript.
 3)It can easily run in a browser or Nodejs.

Install the TypeScript compiler
1)Visual Studio Code includes TypeScript language support but does not include the TypeScript compiler, tsc. 
2)You will need to install the TypeScript compiler either globally.
3)TypeScript source code to JavaScript (tsc HelloWorld.ts).

npm install -g typescript
You can test your install by checking the version or help.
 tsc --version
 tsc --help 

It is important to keep in mind that VS Code's TypeScript language service is separate from your installed TypeScript compiler. 
You can see the VS Code's TypeScript version in the Status Bar when you open a TypeScript file.

VS Code integrates with tsc through our integrated task runner. 
We can use this to transpile .ts files into .js files.

Step 1: Create a simple TS (TS is 
Open VS Code on an empty folder and create a helloworld.ts file.
Programme:-
                 let message: string = 'Hello World';
                console.log(message);
  
TypeScript compiler tsc installed correctly and a working Hello World program, open a terminal and type tsc code.ts. 

javascript Code-
               Var message ='Hello World';
               console.log(message);
the transpiled helloworld.js JavaScript file, which you can run if you have Node.js installed, by typing node code.js.

Ans=Hello World
